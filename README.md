# Bid Pitch

An implementation of the [Bid Pitch][pitch] card game. The goal is to
allow me and my family to play online while we're scattered across the
country.  Based on [Lockport, NY][lockport] local rules :)

Another goal of this project is to make use of interesting
technologies. The server is written in [Clojure][clj] and the client
is written in [ClojureScript][cljs]. Game logic is shared between them
by using [cljx][cljx].

Websockets handle most of the client-server communication.
[Http-kit][httpkit] provides good websocket implementation and James
Henderson's [Chord][chord] provides a nice [core.async][async]
wrapper. I'm not sure if it was necessary but it was very convenient.

Also on the front-end I experimented with Facebook's [React.js][react]
and David Nolen's [Om][om] for a UI rendered by pure functions. Also
not necessary, but I couldn't imagine going back to a life without them.
